 
 Steps to Approve Your Presale Contract from a Gnosis Safe
1. Access the Gnosis Safe Interface:
    * Go to https://app.safe.global and connect your wallet.
    * Open your client's Safe (the one that holds the tokens).
2. Ensure the Safe holds the required tokens:
    * The ERC-20 tokens must be present in this Safe.
3. Prepare the Approval Transaction:
    * Youâ€™ll approve the Presale contract to spend tokens on behalf of the Safe.
4. Use this function from the token contract:function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
5. 
    * spender = address of your presale contract
    * amount = total tokens the contract may transfer (e.g. 3.5B * 1e18)
6. Create a Custom Transaction in Gnosis Safe:
    * Click "New Transaction" > "Contract Interaction"
    * Paste your token contract address
    * It will auto-detect the ABI, or you can enter it manually
    * Choose the approve function
    * Enter:
        * spender: your Presale contract address
        * amount: 3500000000 * 1e18 (or use a calculator and input the number directly)
7. Submit and Execute the Transaction:
    * The Safe owners will need to confirm the transaction (depending on the threshold).
    * Once confirmed, the presale contract will be able to transfer tokens from the Safe.
